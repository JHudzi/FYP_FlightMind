Dependencies: Ubuntu 18.04, Olympe, Python, OpenCV, Numpy, TensorFlow GPU, Sklearn, Imutils, Pickle

Purpose:        In this file functions are used to write and read tro a text file what instructions the drone is to carry out.
                This file is needed due to a breakdown of asynchronous features when streaming from the drone.

Installation: Ubuntu 18.04 ONLT!
                OLYMPE:
                    cd $HOME
                    mkdir code/parrot-groundsdk
                    repo init -u https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/groundsdk-manifest.git
                    repo sync
                    (If some libraries do not install when activating olympe env use pip install to get them)

                CUDDN (for nvidia GPUs only):
                    Follow Ubuntu 18.04 instructions on
                    https://tensorflow.org/install/gpu

                Tensorflow:
                    pip install tensorflow *Remeber to be in the Olympe enviroment *version >2.0 will be GPU capable
